## Project Title: Seattle Airbnb Data Analysis

### Motivation
This repository contains an analysis of Airbnb listings in Seattle, exploring pricing trends, rating factors, and popular neighborhoods.

### Data
Data was sourced from [Kaggle's Seattle Airbnb dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle).

### Questions Answered
1. What are the seasonal trends in pricing across Seattle?
2. What factors impact a listing's average rating or occupancy?
3. Are there certain neighborhoods or property types with the highest bookings?

## Key Findings
- Prices peak in summer, with notable demand in central Seattle neighborhoods.
- Guests may value factors unrelated to price when leaving high ratings, which could indicate the importance of non-monetary aspects such as cleanliness, location, or service quality in determining review scores.
  
### Libraries
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Data Files
- `listings.csv`: Information on each listing, including price, neighborhood, and review score.
- `reviews.csv`: Reviews on each listing.
- `calendar.csv`: Price availability for each listing across dates.
